# General Info

This is my graduation project for a Flutter Training Course and it entails the use of API Requests, OOP, and Flutter Packages.

This project aims to test whether the student gained a certain amount of skill, knowledge, and experience from the course instructor.

## Technologies

The following are the Programming Language and Framework that I used to build this app:
   * [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) 2.16.1 
   * [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 2.10.2 

I also used IntelliJ IDEA 2021.1.3 as my IDE   

The following are the Flutter Packages I used during the development of this app:
   * [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) 0.13.4, Used to make API requests to the back end server.
   * [flutter_conditional_rendering](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_conditional_rendering) 2.0.0, Used this package to render certain widgets according to a certain condition.
   * [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons) 0.9.2, Used this package to generate the launcher icon for the app.
   * [flutter_app_name](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_app_name) 0.1.1, Used this package to change the app name that appears under the app icon after installing it.
   * [page_transition](https://pub.dev/packages/page_transition) 2.0.5, Used this package to animate navigation between UIs and even added a duration to the animation as some high-end devices have high Refresh Rate so the navigation and the animation of it occur super fast and the user don't see it or feel it which degrades the UX for the user and this package fixed this issue.

Currently app not finished.

## App Installation

 * Download the project from the repository.
 * Build it through any IDE that can use Dart (Flutter).
 * After that, you will find your apk inside the project folder called "build" through this path "build\app\outputs\flutter-apk".
